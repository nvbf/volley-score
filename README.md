# Broadcasting (Beach) Volleyball Scoreboard

Creates/Updates eight files with the information you provide from the website.

To be used together with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or another broadcast solution, to provide a (beach) volleyball scoreboard graphical layer from on top of the stream you have from the same host.

This is normally a URL to a webpage that you put on top of the stream.
But we also provide the possibilty to have a image, but then you need to periodically update the image.

There also exist a solution to run against a firebase database. so this can work togheter with beachvolleyball-Scoreboard - [github](https://github.com/nvbf/beachvolleyball-scoreboard) | [webpage](http://live.osvb.no)

By default you can find the application on `http://localhost:3000`.

##

## Creating a redis image
Creating a docker image should be as simple as `docker build -t redis .`

## Running a redis image
`docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 redis`

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Redis

## Environment variables

- `PORT` (optional) : Will default to 3000 if it's not set

## install

```
npm install
```

## Run Example

```
PORT=3000 node index.js
```

## Update from another device

We recommend to install and try [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

With [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) you can access your local website from the internet, and update the local computer from a tablet or similar. Without having to start this app on their computer.

## Deployment on dokku

First, on your **dokku instance**, create an app.

### Create app

```
dokku apps:create <APP_NAME>
```

Then we need to install the dokku redis plugin, and create a redis instance for our app.

### Install and link redis plugin

```
sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-redis.git redis
dokku redis:create <REDIS_NAME>
dokku redis:link <REDIS_NAME> <APP_NAME>

```

### Add dokku git remote

On our own computer, add a dokku git remote that we can push to for deployment:

```
git remote add dokku dokku@your-domain.com:<APP_NAME>
```

Then we can deploy our master branch to this dokku remote every time we want to deploy.

```
git push dokku master
```
